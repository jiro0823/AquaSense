# Backend connection and commissioning

The integrated `water-monitor` publishes its sensor telemetry on MQTT. Actuator
commands are sent only after authenticated API authorization, then delivered by
signed, device-scoped MQTT. The device publishes a signed acknowledgement and
logical output state. Authenticated HTTPS device sync is used for schedule
delivery and state heartbeat; it does not deliver or acknowledge actuator
commands.

## Connect

0. Copy `include/config/device_config.local.example.h` to
   `include/config/device_config.local.h` and set the actual device ID, reachable
   backend HTTPS base URL, and trusted root CA. The local file is ignored by Git.
   Its example values intentionally fail closed; do not commit credentials or CA
   material. Include `/api/v1` in the base URL and include a port only when the
   TLS endpoint does not use its default port.
1. Register the device to the intended farmer/admin through existing
   POST /api/v1/devices (deviceId, name). Confirm it is active. Match
   DeviceConfig::DEVICE_ID. Only one board may consume that ID.
2. Configure Backend's private environment variable:
   DEVICE_KEYS=esp32-feeder-1:YOUR_RANDOM_DEVICE_KEY.
   Multiple entries are comma-separated deviceId:key pairs; keys cannot contain
   commas or colons. Match ignored Secrets::DEVICE_KEY.
3. `BACKEND_API_BASE_URL` must be reachable from the ESP32's Wi-Fi network and
   end in `/api/v1`. Do not use `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or a placeholder host.
   Backend listens on HTTP at its configured `HOST` and `PORT`; production HTTPS
   must terminate at a TLS reverse proxy that forwards `X-Forwarded-Proto: https`.
   For a private development LAN, bind the backend only as needed on that trusted
   network and protect access with the host firewall and an HTTPS endpoint.
   Confirm the certificate covers the exact URL host.
4. HTTPS with certificate verification is the default and requires the trusted
   PEM root certificate in DeviceConfig::BACKEND_ROOT_CA as a C++ raw string.
   Certificate verification is mandatory and needs valid system time. Plain HTTP
   is disabled by default. For isolated local development only, HTTP requires a
   non-release build explicitly compiled with both
   `AQUASENSE_DEVELOPMENT_BUILD` and `AQUASENSE_ALLOW_INSECURE_HTTP`; it is also
   disabled when `NDEBUG` or `AQUASENSE_PRODUCTION_BUILD` is defined. Defining
   the production and insecure-HTTP flags together is a compile error. Do not
   enable this development opt-in for deployment: HTTP exposes the device key.
   An absent CA or placeholder/loopback URL is rejected and backend control stays
   disconnected. Configure a real URL and trust anchor; do not bypass TLS checks.
5. Match broker credentials/topic with Backend MQTT_TOPIC_READINGS. Integrated
   default is water/esp32/readings. The retained public plaintext broker is for
   development; deployment needs private authenticated transport and a separate
   telemetry-security review.
6. Rebuild/restart Backend using its existing workflow. Startup adds nullable
   sensor_readings.orp and creates hardware_commands/hardware_device_states via
   existing model initialization and non-destructive sync. No live database
   migration or server restart was performed in this task.
7. Build/upload following [deployment](deployment.md). Verify telemetry/state with
   relay loads disconnected from power before commissioning.

## API and MQTT contract

User routes use the existing JWT/session authentication, farmer/admin role and
device ownership checks. Cookie-authenticated POST requests also require the
existing CSRF cookie/header pair.

| Method/topic | Direction | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/v1/hardware/commands` | Frontend → Backend | Validate and queue water/aerator/buzzer actions |
| `POST /api/v1/feeding/commands` | Frontend → Backend | Validate and queue manual feeder actions |
| `GET /api/v1/hardware/state?deviceId=...` | Frontend → Backend | Read latest device state and command history |
| `POST /api/v1/hardware/device/sync` | Device → Backend HTTPS | Schedule delivery and state heartbeat only |
| `aquasense/{deviceId}/command` | Backend → ESP32 MQTT | Signed command, QoS 1, always non-retained |
| `aquasense/{deviceId}/state` | ESP32 → Backend MQTT | Signed acknowledgement plus resulting logical state, QoS 1, non-retained |
| Existing `aquasense/...` sensor topics | ESP32 → Backend MQTT | Retained readings and sensor connection state |

Command JSON fields are `v`, `deviceId`, `id` (UUID), `source` (`hardware` or
`feeding`), `action`, `durationMs`, `expiresAt` (UTC epoch milliseconds), and
`signature`. HMAC-SHA256 signs the canonical UTF-8 string:
`v1|deviceId|id|source|action|durationMs|expiresAt`.

State/ack JSON fields are `v`, `deviceId`, `id`, `source`, `action`, `result`,
`reportedAt`, `state`, and `signature`. State contains `fillPump`, `drainPump`,
`aerator`, `feederBusy`, `buzzer`, `automation`, `waterPhase`, `fault`,
`relaysReady`, `timeValid`, `wifiConnected`, `mqttConnected`, and `uptimeMs`.
Backend verifies the signature, registered device, command ID/action/source and
topic device ID before marking a command acknowledged and updating state.

The API returns HTTP 202 with `PENDING` after successful queue/publish. That is
command acceptance, not actuation confirmation. The UI can distinguish pending,
device acknowledgement/rejection and stale/offline state. An `accepted` device
result means accepted by firmware logic; it does not prove electrical relay
operation or water flow. State is the firmware's logical output state.

Backend republishes pending command records every five seconds until an ACK or
expiry. Commands expire after two minutes. Firmware validates HMAC, device ID,
UUID, source/action, expiry and configured RTC/system time; malformed, expired,
unauthenticated or unsupported commands are not actuated. It deduplicates IDs
in non-volatile storage before dispatch. Feeding commands and other one-shot
actions are not retained. The firmware MQTT library callback does not expose the
MQTT RETAIN flag, so non-retained publication, clean-session reconnect behavior,
expiry and durable ID deduplication are the protection layers; a broker-side
retained-command misconfiguration should still be prevented.

## Actions and precedence

| Action | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| FILL, DRAIN | Timed single-pump run; durationMs required and bounded by that pump's configured target and hard maximum |
| WATER_EXCHANGE | Uses configured drain target, settling interval, then configured fill target; API durationMs remains required for contract compatibility but does not set either phase |
| WATER_STOP | Stop water, disable its automation, cancel pending hardware work |
| AERATOR_ON, AERATOR_OFF | Manual relay operation; exits aerator automatic mode |
| AERATOR_AUTO | Enable commissioned temperature hysteresis |
| AUTOMATION_ON, AUTOMATION_OFF | Enable/disable commissioned water exchange policy |
| BUZZER_ON, BUZZER_OFF | Manual pattern; latched water-fault alarm has priority |
| ALL_OFF | Cancel waiting hardware/feeding work and stop active outputs on receipt |
| CLEAR_FAULT | Clear stopped water fault; does not re-enable automation |

Pump command `durationMs` values are positive integers up to 60,000 ms at the
API and dashboard boundary. FILL and DRAIN also require commissioned
per-pump targets and hard limits; a manual request may shorten its target but
cannot extend it. WATER_EXCHANGE requires `durationMs` for API compatibility,
but firmware uses its independently commissioned drain and fill targets.
Firmware rejects any configured hard maximum above 300,000 ms. These are
software limits, not proof that a runtime is safe for a particular tank.
Stops bypass a full hardware queue, but remote stops depend on network and MQTT
delivery and are not physical emergency stops. ALL_OFF leaves faults latched.

Firmware relay polarity is configured active-LOW from the reported module
intent, but the output commissioning gate remains false pending electrical
verification. The MCU cannot control relay inputs while held in reset, so verify
the module's hardware OFF bias and GPIO-to-channel wiring before connecting pump
power. Loss of Wi-Fi or MQTT stops relay-controlled loads; rejected commands
also force those outputs off.

Automatic water exchange is disabled by default. Set
`DRAIN_TARGET_RUNTIME_MS`, `DRAIN_MAX_RUNTIME_MS`, `FILL_TARGET_RUNTIME_MS`,
`FILL_MAX_RUNTIME_MS`, `WATER_EXCHANGE_SETTLING_MS`, `PUMP_COOLDOWN_MS`,
reviewed thresholds, and `WATER_POLICY_CONFIGURED` only after commissioning.
It requires fresh, valid settled pH, turbidity, and ORP data. ORP is not
dissolved oxygen. Aerator automation is separately configured and uses
temperature only; it must not be interpreted as oxygen measurement.

## Feeding and RTC

There are no float switches: this is **timed water exchange**, not measured or
precise automatic water-level control. Configure these values only after flow
testing on the installed pumps, tubing, head height and source conditions:

- `DRAIN_TARGET_RUNTIME_MS` and `DRAIN_MAX_RUNTIME_MS`
- `FILL_TARGET_RUNTIME_MS` and `FILL_MAX_RUNTIME_MS`
- `WATER_EXCHANGE_SETTLING_MS` and `PUMP_COOLDOWN_MS`

All are milliseconds. Target must be positive and strictly less than its pump's
hard maximum; maximum is limited to five minutes. Defaults are zero, so pump
requests fail closed until commissioning. Fill and drain cannot run together.
Each pump has a local nonblocking hard timeout; timeout turns it off and latches
a fault. Duplicate starts do not restart a running timer. A manual stop cancels
the sequence immediately and starts cooldown. During exchange the reported
phases are `DRAINING`, `SETTLING_AFTER_DRAIN`, `REFILLING`, then `COOLDOWN`.
Local timers continue during network loss; no cloud connection is needed to
enforce pump limits. Fault recovery requires an explicit clear command.

### Fill and drain flow calibration

Calibrate the fill and drain pumps separately using the actual installation;
do not copy pump nameplate flow or use one pump's result for the other.

1. Keep relay loads safely isolated while verifying wiring, then test each pump
   with its installed hose length, vertical head, fittings, and actual water
   source/reservoir conditions.
2. Prepare a measured collection volume for the fill test and a measured source
   volume for the drain test. Confirm the destination can safely accept the
   transferred water.
3. Run one pump for a measured interval, then measure the actual volume moved.
   Repeat each pump test 3–5 times under the same installation conditions.
4. For every trial calculate `flow rate = transferred volume / elapsed time`.
   Use consistent units and select a representative rate only after reviewing
   trial variation; investigate unstable results before commissioning.
5. For the intended exchange volume calculate each pump independently:
   `target runtime = intended volume / that pump's measured flow rate`.
   Use the measured installed fill rate for fill and drain rate for drain.
6. Determine the maximum safe run time from physical hazard limits (such as
   source depletion, overflow, or loss of required water), then set each hard
   maximum above its target but below that hazard duration. The firmware also
   rejects maximum values over 300,000 ms. Never use the maximum as the normal
   target.
7. Record the installation, tested pump, hose/head/source conditions, units,
   each trial's volume and elapsed time, calculated rates, chosen intended
   volume, per-pump target and hard maximum, settling interval, cooldown, date,
   and responsible operator.
8. Enter the separately reviewed values in `DRAIN_TARGET_RUNTIME_MS`,
   `DRAIN_MAX_RUNTIME_MS`, `FILL_TARGET_RUNTIME_MS`, and
   `FILL_MAX_RUNTIME_MS`. Set settling and cooldown only after defining the
   operating procedure. Keep all values at zero until physical calibration and
   safety review are complete.

These timers estimate transferred volume; they do not sense water level or
guarantee an exact final volume. Recalibrate after changing pumps, tubing,
vertical height, fittings, water source, or installation conditions. No
production runtime values are supplied here.

Automatic timed water exchange also requires the commissioned per-pump target
and hard-maximum runtimes, settling and cooldown, meaningful
pH/raw-turbidity/ORP thresholds and
WATER_POLICY_CONFIGURED=true, followed by AUTOMATION_ON. It waits for ten samples
and fresh valid pH/turbidity/ORP, then exchanges on out-of-range data. A valid
manual run interrupts automatic operation and leaves it disabled.

Aerator automation is optional temperature control, not oxygen inference. Set
ON above OFF thresholds and AERATOR_POLICY_CONFIGURED=true before AERATOR_AUTO.
Once enabled it turns on for invalid/stale/unsettled temperature. Manual operation
does not need that policy, but does require confirmed relay configuration.

## Feeding and time

Existing feeding API commands TRIGGER, ON, and OFF are delivered through signed
MQTT; authenticated HTTPS sync supplies schedules and heartbeat state.
GPIO18 is the servo signal. Firmware leaves the servo unattached at boot to avoid
moving the mechanism during restart; a valid request attaches it and runs the
25-degree closed, 140-degree open, 25-degree return cycle (800/1000/800 ms).
ON closes after ten seconds. OFF/ALL_OFF suppress scheduled feeding for the
current minute.

Schedules remain the existing **user-wide** list, up to20 enabled entries; they
are not device-scoped. Multiple feeders for one user require a later scheduling
extension. Schedules and last-fired minutes persist in NVS; cached schedules
continue through backend outages. Disable schedules while online and confirm
sync before intentionally suspending offline feeding.

NTP/system time and an optional DS3231 use UTC; dates and HH:mm use Asia/Manila
UTC+8. RTC lost power or unmarked legacy clock contents inhibit schedules until
NTP succeeds. Busy due occurrences use a persisted queue and may run once within
the due minute or the following local minute; older entries expire. The device
persists and reports the latest schedule result (`deferred`, `started`,
`completed`, `cancelled`, `skipped_expired`, or `skipped_queue_full`) with its
schedule ID and local epoch-minute. Stored last-fired records prevent repeats
after resets/backward clock shifts. The reported result is software execution
status and does not prove physical food dispensing.

## Telemetry scope

The integrated device reports pH, temperature, turbidity and signed ORP under
existing `aquasense/` topics. Turbidity uses the distinct `turbidity-ntu` suffix;
legacy raw ADC remains separate. Invalid/disconnected sensor values are not
fabricated. Existing missing-DO compatibility storage remains explicitly
unmeasured. No physical flow/level feedback, live device upload, database
migration or hardware-in-the-loop test was performed.

## Isolated actuator commissioning preparation

This section prepares a future supervised test; it does not authorize or perform
actuation. The `water-monitor-public-dev` profile permanently forces relay,
aerator, feeder, and actuator-commissioning gates off. Its only supported command
for integration checks is the read-only `STATUS_REQUEST`; do not use that public
profile to commission outputs. A future actuator test requires a separately
reviewed, private installation build and an explicit test authorization.

Before that test, keep every actuator load disconnected from external power.
With the MCU unpowered, verify the board pin labels and physically trace GPIO26
and GPIO27 to the relay inputs, then identify the K3/refill and K4/drain paths;
do not infer channel mapping from labels or this document. Verify active-LOW
polarity and a hardware OFF bias during reset with a meter or other appropriate
instrument. Keep the servo unattached and aerator/buzzer loads disconnected.
Record the exact board, wiring, polarity, and measured OFF state. Any uncertain
mapping, unexpected relay state, or powered load stops the procedure.

For a later approved test, use an isolated bench setup with no pump, feeder,
aerator, or other load attached. First verify output logic and state reporting
while loads remain disconnected. If a later separate authorization permits a
load test, energize only the single explicitly approved load, run one short
bounded action, verify OFF, and restore load isolation before testing another
output. Keep an operator at the hardware disconnect throughout. Do not enable
the firmware gates, set runtime values, or attach/energize outputs as part of
this preparation. The public development firmware remains gate-closed.
